Elasticsearch is a distributed search and analytics engine built on Apache Lucene. Since its release in 2010, Elasticsearch has quickly become the most popular search engine and is commonly used for log analytics, full-text search, security intelligence, business analytics, and operational intelligence use cases.

Elasticsearch is used for storing, searching, and analyzing structured and unstructured data in near real-time. One of the key features of Elasticsearch is its scalability, which allows it to handle large datasets across multiple nodes in a cluster.

Beats are lightweight datashippers.They send data from hundreds or thousands of machines and systems to Logstash or Elasticsearch. 

Filebeat -> for logs and otherdata in linux
metricbeat -> metric data
packetdata -> for n/w
winlogbeat -> for windows
hearbeat -> healthcheck, uptime monitoring
auditbrat -> audit data
functionbeat -> serverless shipper for cloud data

elasticsearch installations:
-----------------------------
1)elastic cloud
2)wlastic installation on servers


Download link of elastice search :
https://www.elastic.co/downloads


elastic search rpm download link: - https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-8.11.1-x86_64.rpm
kibana rpm download link: - https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/kibana/kibana-8.11.1-x86_64.rpm


elatic ports: 9200 & 9300
kiban aports: 5601

To install rpms use below commands:
  rpm -ivh elasticsearch-8.11.1-x86_64.rpm  --> copy security information configuration
  rpm -ivh kibana-8.11.1-x86_64.rpm

save below security after installing elastic:
--------------------------- Security autoconfiguration information ------------------------------

Authentication and authorization are enabled.
TLS for the transport and HTTP layers is enabled and configured.

The generated password for the elastic built-in superuser is : Y+3duD+9InyMztdonSgC

If this node should join an existing cluster, you can reconfigure this with
'/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-reconfigure-node --enrollment-token <token-here>'
after creating an enrollment token on your existing cluster.

You can complete the following actions at any time:

Reset the password of the elastic built-in superuser with
'/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-reset-password -u elastic'.

Generate an enrollment token for Kibana instances with
 '/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token -s kibana'.

Generate an enrollment token for Elasticsearch nodes with
'/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token -s node'.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After installing kibana, go to below location:

vi /etc/kibana/kibana.yml
  server.host: "0.0.0.0" (optional)
  elasticsearch.hosts: ["http://localhost:9200"] (uncommebt this) and save file

after restarting kiban - systemctl restart kibana
need to generate token from commands saved after installing elasticsearch
coomad - /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token -s kibana

After pasting token in kibana ui, verification code need to genberate in location
  /usr/share/kibana/bin
  ./kibana-verification-code
