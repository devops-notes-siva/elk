To add one more elasticsearch in same existing server:
----------------------------------------

If we have installed existing elasticsearcxh with rpm we can not install another elasticsearch as rpm was installed by root user.
To install another elasticsearch need to download tar file and extract it:
==================================================
  wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-8.11.1-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
  wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-8.11.1-linux-x86_64.tar.gz.sha512
  shasum -a 512 -c elasticsearch-8.11.1-linux-x86_64.tar.gz.sha512 
  tar -xzf elasticsearch-8.11.1-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
  cd elasticsearch-8.11.1/ 
=================================================================================
Go it bin folder and start elasticsearch but as this elasticsearch uses default folders for data and logs it won't workout. so use different folders elase use below command:

   ./elasticsearch -Enode.name=node-2 -Epath.data=./node-2/data -Epath.logs=./node-2/logs &


master node roles are to craete and delete indices, to make elasticsearch node as dedicated master node make below proprt to true else false
  node.master: true

dat anode: which always stores data, queries like search, performance will perform here, to make dedicated data node below is command
    node.data: true

Ingest node - this node is used for processing, manipulate, processing data. It acts like a logstash, if we are using logstash ingest node not required.
    node.ingest: true(real time not recommended)

machine learning:  node.ml: true -> acts like machine learning
                   xpack.ml.enabled: true 

to run any machine learning jobs we use above properties, it wont affect any other tasks

co-ordination nodes:
 uses is for distrubiyion of queries , logs aggregation if there huge nodes in cluster we will enable this feature
in co-ordination node and all featrures like node.master, node.data, node.ingest, node.ml &  xpack.ml.enabled should make false then only it act like co-ordination node.


voting_only node: used in very big clusters to elct master and data nodes
